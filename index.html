  <h1> Couldve Been</h1>
  
  <h2> Lyrics(first verse)</h2>
    
    <p> Somebody give me, uh
Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (Uh)
Me and you isn't (No)
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
    What good would it be if I knew how you felt about me? (Yeah).</p>

    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <p>
      We could've been<br>
And we try to pretend<br>
Every now and again<br>
We don't dream about, don't think about what<br>
We could've been<br>
Though I'm holding it in<br>
'Cause I know in the end<br>
You dream about, I think about what<br>
We could've been<br>
We could've been (Yeah)<br>
We could've (Damn)
    </p>
